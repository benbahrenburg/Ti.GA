Place your assets like PNG files in this directory and they will be packaged
with your module.

All JavaScript files in the assets directory are IGNORED except if you create a
file named "ti.ga.js" in this directory in which case it will be
wrapped by native code, compiled, and used as your module. This allows you to
run pure JavaScript modules that are pre-compiled.

Note: Mobile Web does not support this assets directory.
